# Architecture

## Structure

Structure of the program is divided into main logics class (app.py), interface capsulation class (console_io.py) and class for object-oriented book references (reference.py). There are also two classes for utilities such as commands and validators. By trying to practice single responsibility and low coupling principles on architecture, it is easier to develop new tests and add new features later.
